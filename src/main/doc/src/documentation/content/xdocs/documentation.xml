      <title>What is DdlUtils</title>
      <p>
        In short, DdlUtils is a library tasks that allows
        the manipulation of schemas in a database. It allows to create and drop complete databases,
        and the creation, alteration and removal of tables.<br/>
        Additionally, it provides an easy way to insert data that is specified in XML, into a database
        and the reverse, extracting data from a database into an XML file.
      </p>
      <p>
        DdlUtils strives to be database independent. The schemas are specified in the database-agnostic
        Turbine XML format that is for instance also used by <a href="ext:torque">Torque</a> and
        <a href="ext:ojb">OJB</a>.
